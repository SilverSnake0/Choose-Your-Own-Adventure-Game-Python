# Choose Your Own Adventure Game

Welcome to the ultimate choose your own adventure game, written in python! This is my first fantasy text game I created which is not just any ordinary game - it's a thrilling and exciting journey through a fantastical world filled with monsters, minigames, and mysteries.

You'll be able to battle or tame fierce monsters using the unique and intuitive monster battle system, and you'll be able to purchase or find all sorts of rare items to help you on your journey.

But that's not all - this game also features a variety of minigames, including blackjack, hangman, rock-paper-scissors, memory guessing games, riddles, and more. There's so many things to discover and do in this game. Your CHOICES also have CONSEQUENCES and change certain aspects of the game, unlocks new storylines, and new endings.
